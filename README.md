# Mr. Kolb's Equation Selector

This Python program, built using Streamlit, is designed to help high school students determine which of the three basic kinematic equations they should use to solve a given physics problem. The program is interactive and provides an easy-to-use interface where students can input what data they know and what they are solving for.
